# possibly good idea list
 - (maybe?) generating "executables" similar to dump_state which can be invoked at a later date (iasm program.bin)
   - additionally, invoking asm files like scripts? (iasm code.asm)
 - reading / writing memory to and from files
 - look into supporting other architectures like ARM / RISC-v / powerpc? (in 300 years)
