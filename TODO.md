# possibly good idea list
 - (maybe?) generating "executables" similar to dump_state which can be invoked at a later date (iasm program.bin)
 - reading / writing memory to and from files
 - look into supporting other architectures like ARM / RISC-v / powerpc? (in 300 years)
 - more colour types
 - more matricies
 - accessing MSR like registers (print IA32_APIC_BASE)

# terrible idea list
 - Bojangles SKU data type
 - Bistro Brotkorb SKU data type
